# WoofeeCakeLab
WoofeeCakeLab_Personal project

Woofee Cake Lab is an Tasmania online cake business run by my partner Bonita and I. 
We established on July 2020 while we are in progress of getting Australian Permanent Residency.
Woofee Cake Lab focus on online order at the beginning.

The project is completely built on my own, from designing, making prototype, building, testing on server, hosting, everything.
